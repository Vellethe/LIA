##This project is a Webscraper.

The program reads through a job website (currently only platsbanken) and stores all the job ads in a database for you to easly read and filter through.
It's written with a React frontend while the backend is done in C#, these technologies were used because of some level of comfort for us having previous experience in
C# backend while having React as a frontend was new and challenging. There is some regex that could have been improved and also some data fetching that sometimes
shows the information twice cause of the ad publishers or showing weird names because of uppercase letters in the description that we gather from.

All packages that are needed/used by the project should automaticly come with the folder. You probably need to run "update-database" but outside of that everything should work
